This theme is based on the symbol of the balance scales.
It illustrates Bountysource as a rewarding process.

The scales convey the idea of justice and measurement,
of an equilibrium between sponsors and developers
put on the same level by the Bountysource service.

The following copy could be associated with the illustration of the scales:

## Rewarding Open Source since 2006

* As a sponsor, reward developers who fix issues or develop new features
  in the open source projects that you use

* As a developer, choose your challenges, spend time on rewarding issues
  and make a living working on open source projects
